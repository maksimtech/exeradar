# was the documented release path that was broken; patchradar's bump_version.py had
# the same defect, found the same week.

# Here there was nothing to be broken. exeradar had no release script at all, so
# every release of it went out by hand — which is why the suite gate the other four
# received had nowhere to live, and why this file exists.
